Wildfire occurs frequently in the state of California. The combustion would cause severe issues not only to the environment but also to the wellness of local communities. This model aims to predict wildfire occurance based on several environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, vegetation types, and wind direction etc. I'm applying machine learning model such as linear regression and random forest regression to perform the prediction.
