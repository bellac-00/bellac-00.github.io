Wildfire occurs frequently in the state of California. The combustion would cause severe issues not only to the environment but also to the wellness of local communities. This model aims to predict wildfire occurance based on several environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, NDVI (National Difference Vegetation Index), etc. I'm applying machine learning model to this project.
