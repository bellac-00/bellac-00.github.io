Air quality is a persistent environmental challenge with significant implications for public health and well-being. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standardized measurement used to represent air quality, including capturing the concentrations of ambient air pollution such as particulate matter (PM) and ground-level ozone. Understanding the AQI in our surroundings is crucial for assessing environmental risks and their impact on public health. This model aims to predict AQI levels in California, enabling better decision-making, public awareness, and proactive measures to mitigate health risks associated with air pollution.
